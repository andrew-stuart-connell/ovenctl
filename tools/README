nmbtest:
	This allows you to get & set individual words on the remote device.
	./nmbtest <remote> -a<addr> [-w<val>] [-v]
	<remote> may be hostname or IP address.
	<addr> and <val> are in hex.
	-v selects Verbose mode (A transcript of all TCP traffic is produced)
	E.g. to read from 0x22D0: ./nmbtest -a22d0
	E.g. to write 0x0064 to 0x9ef0: ./nmbtest -a9ef0 -w64
	./nmbtest -h
	Produces short help.
	Return value:
		0	OK
		1	MODBus error
		2	Bad commandline
		3	Socket error
		255	Function not supported

nmbdump:
	This allows you to dump a section of the remote device memory.  (Handy for reverse-engineering & discovering the addresses of undocumented registers)
	./nmbdump <remote> -a<addr> -l<length> [-v]
	<remote> may be hostname or IP address.
	<addr> and <length> are in hex.
	Note that the dump data, <addr> and <length> are all in words, not bytes.
	-v selects Verbose mode (A transcript of all TCP traffic is produced)
	Typical usage:
		./nmbdump <remote> -a0 -l2000 > <name>.dump 2>/dev/null &
		grep " [[:xdigit:]]\{4\}" <name>.dump > <name>.hex
		diff -u <name>.hex <other>.hex | less
