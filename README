    Send one-shot commands to an oven
    See the --help output and the docstrings (in Python, import ovenctl, help(ovenctl))
    Quick reference:
        ./ovenctl.py -H <hostname> -Q # query
        ./ovenctl.py -H <hostname> -T <temp> # turn on
        ./ovenctl.py -H <hostname> -T <temp> -W # turn on and wait for temp to be reached
        ./ovenctl.py -H <hostname> -I # turn off ('i'dle)

rampspec.py:
    Drive an oven through a temperature profile consisting of a chain of canned elements
    See the --help output for basic usage info
    See doc/rampspec.htm for details of the 'rampspec' format for defining the temperature profile

ramptool.py:
    Generate canned rampspecs for simple profiles with repeated eXecs
    See the --help output for usage info, doc/rampspec.htm for explanation
